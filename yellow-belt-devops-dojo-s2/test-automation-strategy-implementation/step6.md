To facilitate the work of Pet Clinic development team the following system / program implementation actions were agreed.

1. Decided what test cycles including load, security, E2E, integration are to be performed at what stages of the Continuous Delivery and post deployment phases of the development cycle.

2. Specified the environments and triggers for each of the system / program test cycles.

3. Appointed owner(s) for the system / program test cycles, owners are to take point on the test case creation, resourcing and test cycle execution.

4. Created program level test collateral and program level test protocols including protocols for test environment creations, resetting and test execution co-ordination.

5. Defined the actions to take when testing identifies an issue for example rollback to a previous state or roll forward fixing.

6. Created a representative Data Set that can be used by the various test cycles. Testing has to start and finish at a known point, the Data Set can provide that starting point.

7. Documented the engagement model to be used with the relevant stakeholders so that when program level testing identifies an issue that the stakeholders need to address they can be engaged.

Having agreed the team and system / program level actions needed to implement their test automation strategy, the team prioritize with the most important action of all being the team deciding to **START AUTOMATING!**
