The Pet Clinic team have moved to a DevOps model. Their objective is to have unit, functional, integration and E2E testing ran from their CI/CD Pipelines.

They also want to have certain non functional test suites ran against dedicated test environments. These test suites are to be triggered on demand or to an agreed schedule.

While test automation is everyone's responsibility. A Test Automation sub team has been formed under the auspices of a DevOps Kaizen event with **T**ina being the defacto product owner to create the Pet Clinic's test automation strategy. The sub team includes representatives from the development team and from the stakeholders responsible for the delivery of program level non functional testing.

The team have ensured with **C**hun's coaching that their objectives in the implementation of a test automation strategy are aligned with the 3 Ways of DevOps

1. Take a - Systems Thinking - approach to test automation.

2. Amplify Feedback Loops - including making test automation metrics visible, and publishing the issues testing identifies.

3. Facilitate a Culture of Experimentation and Learning - including sharing at a program level of what test automation approaches work and just as importantly which ones doesn't work for the Pet Clinic team.
