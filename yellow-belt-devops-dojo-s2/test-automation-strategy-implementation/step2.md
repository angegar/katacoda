**P**aulo reminds the team that _Pet Clinic has a need, a need for speed_.

Test automation is a key enabler of that need for speed in development, continuous integration and continuous delivery. The team are committed to the 3 Ways of DevOps, their credo is  _"you build it, you test it, you run it"_.

**T**ina having worked with **C**hun on the Pet Clinic Test Automation Strategy proposes that the program take an inner source approach to testing with two main test categories.

- Team level tests including unit and acceptance / functional testing.
- System or Program level tests including End to End Tests, Load/Performance and Dynamic Security testing.

**C**hun has recommended that the team take an inner sourced approach to test automation.

Inner sourcing test automation allows the team test automation contributions from all stakeholders including Development, Operations, Other Business Units and Partners.

**S**anthosh who is facilitating the teams Kaizen events, suggests focusing the next Kaizen cycle on Test Automation.

**T**ina agrees that to successfully implement a test automation strategy there is a need to understand the current state of testing and agree the desired end state of test automation. This is needed both at the team level and at the program level. The desired end state being also referred to as the Definition of Awesome.

**S**anthosh explains that understanding where you are starting from and where you want to go is essential to any journey. It allows any deltas to be identified and a transition plan put in place to facilitate the move from current state to the desired end state. The transition plan(s) can be then run as a series of progressive DevOps Kaizen events.

He reminds everyone that an Improvement Theme is a tool that can be used by teams to create a conveyor belt of continuous incremental improvements.

This is **Test Automation Strategy Implementation** and this is the team that will be implementing the Pet Clinic Test Automation Strategy.
