Having concluded that everyone in the Pet Clinic development team owns test automation.

The team during one of their regular DevOps Kaizen Events led by their scrum master **S**anthosh agree the following Guiding Principles for Test Automation.

- Testing Improvement Theme
 - Establish one for the team.
 - Current state to be assessed, awesome to be defined.
 - Kaizen Continuous improvement events to be scheduled to address deltas between current state and awesome.

- No formal functional test cycles to be used
 - Test types / definitions to be created.
 - Functional testing to be embodied in each sprint.
 - Tests to be demonstrated with functionality during sprint reviews as part of definition of done.

- Automated Testing is to be integrated within the CI/CD pipelines (push and pull)
 - Unit Test to be included in Definition of Done for each user story.
 - Pipelines to be stopped when build is broken.
 - Test environments to be established.
 - CI/CD pipelines to apply more aggressive / comprehensive testing as testing progresses to higher level environments.

- Manual testing only to be used where test automation is not possible

- Dedicated Test Cycles for work that cannot be embodied in their CI/CD pipelines
 - Performance Testing
 - Penetration Testing
 - Dynamic Security Scans

- Plan to make work visible and publish
 - Test Strategies
 - Build failures
 - Test metrics defined, dashboards established etc.
 - Defect tracking system published
