The Test Automation Strategy has implications for all aspects of a project.

- Architecture - Architects need to provide test guidance with architectural epics and stories.

- Continuous Integration - Execute unit tests and functional tests from the applications Continuous Integration / 'Push' pipeline(s).

- Continuous Delivery / Deployment - Execute integration, end to end tests, smoke and golden transactions from the applications Continuous Deployment / 'Pull' pipeline(s) in the designated test environment(s)

- Pre-Deployment - Execute system wide tests including load/performance, security (static and dynamic) in designated test environment(s)

- LessOps - Incorporate Operate Optimize Secure and Scale (OOSS) principles in the application ensuring these and any other enabler user stories are tested in the same manner as business user stories are tested.

- Security - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
