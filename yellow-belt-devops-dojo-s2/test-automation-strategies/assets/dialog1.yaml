    How do we and how should we view test automation?
---
speaking: Chun

    A cure for all ills? Something we get around to when there is time?
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    Across the company, both in this team and in the other development teams testing is occurring to varying degrees.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    The testing being performed includes a mixture of manual and automated testing.
---
speaking: Tina
text: >
    We need test automation bonded to the DNA of our applications.
---
speaking: Santhosh
text: >
    Bonded in to our applications DNA, I like it Tina.
---
speaking: Chun

    DevOps enables a culture where development and operations come together to build, test and deploy applications.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    In such a culture teams continuously drive to reduce the overall cycle time.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    The nirvana being the ability to do multiple production deployments daily.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Tina I understand prior to this initiative the team were following a Waterfall methodology?
---
speaking: Tina
text: >
    Yes we were.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Would you be kind enough to gives an overview of the practices, advantages and challenges you and the test team had working within that model?
---
speaking: Tina
text: >
    In the Waterfall model testers were allocated time to run test cycles when development teams were finished developing and code was deemed ready for potential deployment.
---
speaking: Tina
text: >
    That model worked but it relied on set cycles for system integration, UAT (User Acceptance Tests), performance and security testing.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    That methodology doesn't however scale well in the world Paulo described which is one of ever decreasing cycle times.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Nor does it scale well in a world where teams target multiple deployments daily.
---
speaking: Tina
text: >
    In such scenarios, we are seeing that there isn't time for formal test cycles. Testing needs to be continuous.
---
speaking: Tina
text: >
    Of course the products still need to be tested. This is where test automation becomes mandatory. It could have been an investment we could avoid with long cycles, but not anymore.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Exactly. In addition, test automation is a complex discipline which needs to be planned and supported by all stakeholders.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Test automation is often a major differentiator as to why some DevOps projects fail and others succeed.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    How so?
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Test automation requires Developer and Testers to have a broad understanding of the application functionality, the underlying architecture, platform and test automation tools.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    It also requires that they know how to apply those tools and create tests in parallel to the development and that they can invoke the test suites from CI/CD pipelines.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Test automation is what gives you the confidence to deploy application updates and patches as testing happens continuously. Each code change will trigger automated test execution.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    Understood. Thanks Chun and Tina for that overview.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    Our mission should we choose to accept it, would appear to be to ensure test automation is bonded into the DNA of our applications.
---
speaking: Tina
text: >
    How could we refuse such an important mission?
