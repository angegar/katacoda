## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo** Test Automation Strategies module.

## Purpose

The main aim of every software development team is to deliver high quality software to the business at an agreed cadence. Testing is performed in an attempt to ensure that the applications developed are defect free and that applications fulfill business expectations before they are deployed.

The primary objective of the "Test Automation Strategies" module is to help you to understand that a well designed test automation strategy is a key enabler of the speed promised by DevOps practices.

Inadequate planning is one of the main reasons for the failure of test automation initiatives. Test automation plans have to be detailed and realistic. Planning for 100% test automation from day one is an unrealistic, and depending on the test type, potentially an unachievable test automation objective.

Teams should set time aside to define a strategy documenting their approach to test automation. The aim should be to create a cost-effective test automation strategy underpinned by a data driven result-oriented approach.

The secondary objective is to give you an opportunity to virtually participate in a Test Automation Strategy creation real world scenario using Katacoda.

If you have not completed the Welcome module you should do so before continuing with the Test Automation Strategies module.

By the end of the lesson and lab, you will be able to:

* Explain the importance of defining a Testing Mission Statement.

* Outline the challenges facing teams as they move to introduce test automation.

* List test automation guiding principles.

* Consider and evaluate different approaches to Test Automation.

* Describe the test types that comprise the Test Automation Pyramid.

* Articulate the need for and create a Test Automation Strategy.

* Understand the implications of testing for each stage of the typical development life cycle.
