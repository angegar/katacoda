**C**hun recommends that the team document their strategy for Test Automation.

**D**an and **T**ina say the team already have a test strategy which can be used as a starting point.

**C**hun agrees but notes it probably needs a root and branch review with a view to updating it based on the recently reviewed guidelines.

**C**hun explains that test automation strategies are not the preserve of DevOps. Teams following a Waterfall methodology have test strategies but what is changed with the advent of DevOps is the degree of automation, the pace of change and the shift left in terms of test execution.

By way of illustration **C**hun introduces the team to the test automation pyramid.

She explains that development teams should align with the test automation pyramid when automating tests and that they should automate to degree necessary and practical to support their deliverables.

**C**hun further explains that teams should be encouraged to view test automation execution as a funnel in their CI/CD pipelines where code goes in and potentially shippable product comes out.

The team note that as you climb the test automation pyramid the number of tests decreases.

At the base there is a need for a lot of unit tests with a minimum of 70% to 80% coverage being recommended.

Inverting the pyramid gives a different perspective, that of a a test automation factory where the production line is comprised of a series of test automation machines and the output is potentially shippable code.

**P**aulo thanks **C**hun for the overview. He reminds the team of their mission statement which is the need to have test automation bonded to the DNA of their architecture, development, build, packaging, deployment and operations practices.

**T**ina agrees to work with the wider team to apply the principles of the test automation pyramid.

This requires the application of a range of test methodologies including both Functional and Non Functional Testing.
