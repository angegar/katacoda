Every development team should have a test automation strategy.

The test strategy should address topics like the following

- The environment
- The current testing state
  - Planned
  - In progress
  - Implemented
  - Not applicable and why
- Test methodology
  - Automated
  - Manual
    - Where are test cases stored?
- Test tools and technologies used
- Test coverage
- Test Scope
- Frequency tests will be run
- Expected duration of test cycle execution
- Tests trigger mechanism
- Process followed when a test reports an error
- Location where will test results and metrics are published
- Location where defects are logged
  - Git issue at repository or via some other tool?

The test strategy should address testing needs in all phases of the application development cycle and should cover all applicable test types.
