Common Test Automation Types include

### Functional Testing

- **Unit Testing**

Focuses on smallest unit of software design where an individual unit or group of inter related units is tested. Typically unit testing is performed by developers writing tests to test individual methods and functions of an application's classes, components or modules by providing sample inputs and verifying expected outputs.

**Functional Testing**

 Functional tests are tests which verify the actual functionality of the system meets business requirements. They verify that the expected output is generated in response to User inputs and actions.
 
- **Integration Testing**

Integration testing is testing in which a group of components or services are tested to verify they work together to produce the expected output.

- **Regression Testing**

Every change to a code base results in a change to associated application, component or service. Regression testing ensures that pre-existing function still works as expected after new features are added.

- **End to End Testing**

End-to-end (E2E) testing verifies that various user flows work as expected it replicates a user behavior with the software in a complete application environment. E2E are complex to develop and can be difficult to maintain so most applications have a few key E2E tests supported by a foundation of suites of unit and integration tests.

- **Smoke Testing**

Smoke testing is testing done as a post deployment sanity check to ensure the application, component or service works as expected and does not catch fire or smoke when enabled.

### Non-Functional Testing

- **Performance Testing**

Performance Testing is done to check test speed and effectiveness of an application and thus determine whether the application meets the performance requirements.

- Baseline Test - Setting up real-time latency metrics, CPU metrics, etc., to set the minimum performance thresholds.
- Stress Test - This testing is done when a system is stressed beyond its specifications in order to check how and when it fails.

- **Security testing**

The are a number of automated security testing types.

  - Dynamic (DAST) - A security testing methodology in which an application is tested from the outside in its running state by simulating an attack.
  - Static (SAST) - A testing methodology which tests the application from the inside out by examining its source code for conditions that indicate a security vulnerability might be present.
  - Penetration Testing - The practice of testing a computer system, network or Web application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.
