The Pet Clinic development team have started to implement Test Driven Development (TDD). They are adding unit tests as the add new functions and features. 

As is to be expected given they have only recently started with TDD the current test code coverage % is low. 

They also have some automated functional tests with user stories in their backlog to create additional tests for a number of critical flows. As a result **T**ina and the testers still have to do a lot of manual testing for each release.

With the introduction of TDD and automated functional testing, the team are starting to see encouraging results. Some issues are being detected by tests ran from the team's continuous integration pipeline when developers submit pull requests. Results are however patchy with bugs and performance issues being detected in upper environments.

**P**aulo, following his regular product backlog grooming meeting with the business, explains to the development team that the pace of change is accelerating and that he expects that a monthly release will soon be no longer viable. He outlines that **B**renda and the business are looking for weekly initially and ideally daily releases.

**P**aulo asks **A**dam for any observations he has on the performance of the application following the recent introduction of the Fair Trade Pet Products Line. Adam describes that they are seeing spikes in business around holidays, sales events etc., with some performance issues being experienced at peak times.

**P**aulo calls a meeting and asks **C**hun for her thoughts as to how the team can build on the progress shown to date and take the next steps in Test Automation.

This is **Test Automation Strategies** and these are the people that will create the Test Automation Strategy for the Pet Clinic team.
