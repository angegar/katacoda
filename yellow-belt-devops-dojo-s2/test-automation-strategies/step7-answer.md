The correct answer is **All of the above**

The following are guiding principles for test automation

* Testing Improvement Theme

* No formal functional test cycles to be used

* Automated Testing is to be integrated within the CI/CD pipelines (push and pull)

* Manual testing only to be used where test automation is not possible

* Dedicated Test Cycles for work that cannot be embodied in their CI/CD pipelines

* Plan to make work visible and publish test results
