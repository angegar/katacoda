The term ChatOps is an amalgamation of Chat and Operations. ChatOps is a relatively new operational model which supports conversation-driven development.

In the ChatOps paradigm teams use a collaboration tool like Slack or MS Teams to work together in one or more chat rooms or channels. Team members enter commands and questions into the chat room, these are commands and questions for which ChatBots have been created to execute or to respond to via a series of custom scripts and plugins. ChatBots are sometimes referred to as Robots.

ChatBots should be within the context of the collaboration tool be considered as members of your team to which you can send a request and get an instant response.

The commands executed and questions responded by a ChatBot are only limited by your imagination, that is they are only limited by what you can put an API in front of. The services provided can range from commands to trigger code deployments, to questions that query application and system logs, to questions which query security event responses, to commands for logging issues and for team member notifications.

ChatOps allows development and operations teams to include their tools as active participants in their conversations, allowing them to collaborate in real time and to work faster in an agile manner to automate tasks. This form of conversation driven collaboration is changing how people work.

Teams that use ChatOps are constantly finding new and innovative ways of automating tasks. With ChatOps, work is shared and visible to all in a central place the channel in the teams collaboration tool.
