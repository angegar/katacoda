ChatOps is comprised of three main components.

Collaboration tool: The chat application used by the team to work in. There are a number of chat platforms including MS Teams and Slack.

ChatBot: In the teams' collaboration tool the ChatBot acts as the interlocutor between the person making the request and the tools servicing the request. The ChatBot accepts requests from team members, then executes commands against or to retrieve information from integrated systems and tooling. There are a number of popular tools for creating ChatBots including Hubot, Lita and Cog.

Back-end system integration: The back-end system that the ChatBot interacts with. These back-end can include :

    JIRA for issue creation and tracking.
    GitHub for version control.
    Jenkins for continuous integration, delivery and deployment.
    Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure and others for provisioning and infrastructure as code (IAC).
    Grafana for monitoring.

The potential for automation using ChatOps is truly limitless.
