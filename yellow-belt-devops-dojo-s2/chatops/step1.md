As the Pet Clinic team progress with their DevOps transformation they have increased their use of 'DevOps' tooling in support of the transformation. Tools introduced include GitHub for source code management and version control, Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous delivery, and Artifactory for binary management.

In parallel to the adaption of tooling **P**aulo is encouraging the team to continue to work to evolve their culture. **C**hun states that in her opinion transforming the culture is just as important, if not more important as the introduction of new tooling in successful DevOps transformations.

The primary goal of the Pet Clinics DevOps transformation is to reduce the time it takes the Pet Clinic development team to deliver business value into production. The software delivered has to be defect free with problems being detected and corrected as early as possible in the development cycle. The adaption of DevOps promotes practices which enable and demand better communication and thus collaboration between development teams and IT Operations.

With **C**hun help and guidance the Pet-Clinic DevOps transformation is focused on the introduction a Culture of Automation, Measurement and Sharing (CAMS). **D**an the developer and **A**dam the SRE have suggested the team evaluate and potentially use ChatOps in support of the desired CAM culture.
