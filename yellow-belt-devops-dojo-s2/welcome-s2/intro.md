## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo - Stripe 2** Katacoda course.

## The DevOps Dojo Yellow Belt - Second Stripe

This course is the second stripe of your DevOps Dojo Yellow Belt.

It is made of **7** modules:

* Binary Management - Continuous Integration

* Binary Management - Continuous Delivery

* Infrastructure As Code

* Monitoring

* Trunk Based Development

* Test Automation Strategies

* Test Automation Strategies - Implementation

Each modules awards a badge. Once you complete all modules, you will get the second stripe on your Yellow Belt. Assuming of course you have completed **Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo - Stripe 1**.

## Katacoda environment

The modules make use of Katacoda environments. Those are ephemeral environments which are created just for you, on the fly. They will time out after one hour. The good news is that you can explore around and get out of the script: it is your own environment.

So, go grab a cup of your favorite tea or coffee, close your email, put your phone on plane mode, and let's get started!

## Welcome module

In this Welcome module lab, we will get you started and setup a dedicated environment for you, to allow you complete the labs for the other modules in the  **Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo - Stripe 2** at your own pace.

The environment for **Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo - Stripe 2** is completely separate to the environment for **Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo - Stripe 1**. Aside from some noted exceptions you can take the modules in any order from any Stripe in support of your personal learning objectives.

First, to begin let us revisit the story of a business formed by the CEO Charlie, a DevOps team, an application and its delivery chain (continuous delivery pipeline).
