### Story

We join the team as they are engaged in one of their scheduled Kaizen events.

In their Kaizen events they assess current state, refine their ever evolving definition of awesome and decide on the next steps to take to address any deltas between their current state and the desired awesome state.

One of the challenges identified by the team is how and where to manage the increasing number of artifacts they are producing as their software development processes accelerate.

**Chun** is advocating the use of a Binary Management tool.

**Santhosh** who is leading the Kaizen event asks Chun to give the team an overview of Binary Management.
