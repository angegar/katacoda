### Story

We join the team as they are engaged in one of their scheduled DevOps Kaizen events.

In their Kaizen events the team assess current state, refine their ever evolving definition of awesome, decide on the next steps to take to address any deltas between their current state and the desired awesome state.

One of the challenges identified by the team is how and where to manage the increasing number of artifacts they are producing as their software development processes accelerate.
