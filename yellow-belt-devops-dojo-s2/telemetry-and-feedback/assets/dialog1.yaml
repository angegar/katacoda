    We already have some operational metrics for the IT infrastructure.

    Why and how can they be improved?

    The problem is that we don't have any insight into what's happening inside the application code.

    For example, we might see a server is busy, with high CPU usage.

    But we don't know whether that's to be expected because of what the users are doing, whether there's a problem with the application code or whether it's a symptom of an issue elsewhere in the IT estate.

    All of the source code is visible to the whole team, in our Version Code system.

    Can't the System Administrators work with Dan and the developers to study the code to understand the root causes for what's happening?

    Bear in mind if the system is down there's a business impact for every second of an outage. We need to make it quick to identify the issue.

    We also need to remember that the System Administrators are not Developers - they're not experts in reading source code - so even with the assistance of Dan and the team there are lots of things that won't be evident from a "static" assessment of code

    So ideally you need a "dynamic" view of what's happening with the system?

    Exactly.

    At my last company we used a tool called StatsD for monitoring which was developed by the team at Etsy. Maybe we could start with that?

    I've also heard that other organisations use Splunk.

    Thanks Dan and Tina.

    Those suggestions sound interesting. Let me do some research and brief you all on the findings.

    Once more it sounds like we have a plan, and you know me I love it when a plan comes together.
