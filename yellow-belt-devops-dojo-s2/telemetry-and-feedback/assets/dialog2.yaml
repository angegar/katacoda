    Those insights will definitely reduce the time it takes to get everything back up and running after and incident which will in turn reduce the impact on the business.

    As I said I love it when a plan comes together.

    When we have the Epics and Stories to create the monitoring data and the usage of that monitoring data, we can focus on the priority items.
