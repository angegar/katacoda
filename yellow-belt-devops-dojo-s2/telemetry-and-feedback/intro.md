## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo** Telemetry and Feedback module.

## Purpose

The primary objective of the **Telemetry and feedback** module is to explain the benefits of implementing comprehensive, automated Monitoring of IT systems.

In some of the References and in other resources which cover this topic, the term Monitoring is used instead, but the two terms are effectively equivalent. Logging and Alerting are closely related topics which are also outlined in this module.

The secondary objective is to illustrate how the Pet Clinic team plan to implement Monitoring for their application and the benefit they expect to gain from the implementation of monitoring.

If you have not completed the Welcome module of the **Yellow Belt DevOps Dojo - Stripe 2** you should do so before continuing with the Telemetry and Feedback module.

By the end of the module you will be able to:

* Explain the different types of metrics which are beneficial to monitor.

* Articulate the benefits of Monitoring - to your development team, to the IT admins / SRE's and to business teams.

* Understand the difference between Logging, Monitoring and Alerting.

* Understand how best to approach Monitoring of your own applications.
