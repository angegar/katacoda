The Pet Clinic team have made significant progress on their DevOps journey. They have all of their code under Version Control and they have automated tests which get run as both from the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines.

As a result, the team has more confidence when making application changes in order to deliver additional business benefit. Most of these benefits are delivered in the form of incremental changes which are released frequently and deployed without incident.

However, there are still occasions when performance degrades or outages occur in Production. Sometimes

* Code changes have unexpected consequences which were not highlighted by the automated tests.

* There are other changes or failures in the wider IT environment which affect the functionality or performance of the Pet Clinic application.

* Changes to the way the application is used can cause operational issues - for example when there is a peak usage at a particular time of day or during particular events.

When these outages happen. there can be a significant impact on the operation of the Pet Clinic business. These outages cause additional work for the Staff and frustration for the Customers.
