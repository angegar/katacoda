At one of their regular DevOps Kaizen events, the team review what can be done to address the business impact of these outages.

**Brenda** explains she is frustrated by how long it takes to detect and resolve outages with the Pet Clinic application. She also explains that these outages can disrupt the operations of the company.

**Santhosh** states that it's not practical to completely eliminate outages or other operational issues. While more comprehensive testing can mitigate a lot of the risks, operational issues are a natural consequence of the continuous improvements being made to the IT systems.

**Chun** agrees and suggests that the most effective thing to do is to focus on reducing the _duration_ of outages - what is sometimes known as the Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).

**Adam** explains that while he and his colleagues are experienced IT administrators/SREs they sometimes find it difficult to pin-point the exact root cause of operational issues.
He points out they don't have any systems to help them see how the applications interact with the rest of the IT landscape, understand "what normal looks like" and quickly assess cause-and-effect when things go wrong.

**Paulo** asks how much effort it will require to implement that sort of capability. As everyone is aware there are plenty of tasks on the Product Backlog to deliver direct benefit to the many business users and customers, so work on enabler functions for operational issues has to be justified in terms of expected benefits delivered for the operational staff.

**Santhosh** proposes that as the business users are directly impacted by any IT outages, there is quantifiable Business Value in reducing the MTTR for IT outages.

**Dan** says his previous company used some Open Source tools to provide good insights into how their IT systems were performing so it needn't take much effort to implement something to help Adam and his colleagues during outages. He also explains that having a better view of how the application behaves in Production will also help the Developers when they're planning changes.

**Tina** agrees on the need to have a better understanding how the application behaves in Production as it will help with the design of both functional and non functional tests.

**Santhosh** agrees to schedule time in the next set of Kaizen events to discuss the topic in more detail. This will allow the team to create some Epics and User Stories in the Product Backlog to explore the use of Monitoring as a means of reducing the MTTR for IT system outages and hence be available for selection in a future development Sprint.

The team have decided to explore the use of Monitoring as a means of reducing the MTTR for IT system outages.

This is **Telemetry and Feedback** and this is the team that wants to apply it in support of the Pet Clinic applications.
