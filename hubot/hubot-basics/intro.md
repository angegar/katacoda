## Why to use a chatbot

- Make Dev and Ops collaborate without a re-org
- Connect distributed teams​
- Create a central point to manage/monitor your development, release and deployment process
- “hyper connectivity” between people and the continuous delivery pipeline​
- Add “super powers” with bots
